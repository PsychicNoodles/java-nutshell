#What is this?
This is a simple guide/cheatsheet for learning and reviewing Java. It covers all the basics and useful bits of Java programming that will be helpful for most everyday projects.

The goal is to provide a foundation for exploring Java. It's pretty hard to get started with something like learning a programming language, but after that hurdle, hopefully, it will be simple enough to find and pick up new libraries and frameworks.

#Nice title
Thanks. This guide is supposed to be rather brief ("nutshell"), while still effective and descriptive, as well as done "the hard way". It's supposed to be based off of [these guides](http://learncodethehardway.org/), which are quite fantastic, by the way, if you're interested in learning Python or Regex (or any of the other languages offered). The idea is that you need to be writing out the examples, not just copy and pasting them.

You should try going to the Github Pages website [here](http://PsychicNoodles.github.io/java-nutshell) for the actual guide part. You can look through the src/ folder for the plain .java files used.
